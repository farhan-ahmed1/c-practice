This repository contains several practice programs written in C to help you learn basic programming concepts such as control flow, pointers, and more.

## Directory Structure

- **basic-concepts/**
  - **basic-1/**  
    Contains [main.c](basic-concepts/basic-1/main.c) which demonstrates printing personal information, checking the C standard version, and printing patterns.
  - **basic-2/**  
    Contains an empty [main.c](basic-concepts/basic-2/main.c) for future exercises.
- **Pointers/**
  - [pointer-types.c](Pointers/pointer-types.c)  
    Demonstrates pointer arithmetic, typecasting, and working with void pointers.
  - [pointer](Pointers/pointer)  
    Currently an empty placeholder file.
- **Control Flow/**  
  (Directory created for control flow examples.)
- **README.md**  
  This file.

## How to Run

To compile any of the C files, use `gcc`. For example, to compile and run the basic example:
```sh
gcc basic-concepts/basic-1/main.c -o main && ./main
